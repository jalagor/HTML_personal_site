    <h1>John thinks you should give these albums a listen</h1>
    <h2>A Subjective List</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>In the Aeroplane over the Sea - Neutral Milk Hotel</h3>
    <p>A great indie album, mixing brass, acoustic guitars and excellent lyrics.</h4>
    <h3> To Pimp a Butterfly - Kendrick Lamar</h3>
    <p> Perhaps my favorite rap album. The best moment is perhaps the transition from A1 to How Much a Dollar Really Cost.</p>
    <h3>9 Dead Alive - Rodrigo y Gabriela </h3>
    <p>Spanish guitar is fantastic and if you haven't heard any, start here.</p>
    <h3>Discovery - Daft Punk</h3>
    <p>Daft Punk was my first introdcution to EDM, and this album was the gateway.</p>
    <h3>Jungle - Jungle</h3>
    <p>smooth. cool. funky. Bust out the audiophile setup.</p>
    <h3>Omnium Gatherum - King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard</h3>
    <p>This band has so much music, and it hits tons of genres. They put on one of the best performances I've ever seen.</p>
